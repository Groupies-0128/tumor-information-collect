I've just known the differences between git and github.
Try to push a tiny code on github
Few years later, I'm sure I'll laugh at this code.
But whatever? Everything has the first step.

I'll be a second year postgraduate student one month later.
However, I still haven't got my first network.
I know I should study harder and harder.

Get off work, bye.
